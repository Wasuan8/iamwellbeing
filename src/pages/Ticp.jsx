                In India’s current climate, the number of people in need of mental health care far exceeds the number of professionals equipped to provide it,
                and this gap has only widened over the past decade. While recent years have brought greater awareness to the need for mental health interventions,
                they have also laid bare an uncomfortable truth: we simply do not have enough trained professionals to meet the staggering demand. Every day,
                new data emerges, whether it is an <strong>increasingly high number of deaths by suicide or severe mental and physical health concerns like chronic illnesses,
                  heart problems, and autoimmune diseases.</strong>

                If we are to address this crisis, we must go beyond treating surface-level ‘symptoms’ and work towards the <strong>root causes.</strong> This requires a <strong>holistic,
                  trauma-informed approach,</strong> one that is inclusive, culturally contextualised, and deeply de-stigmatising.

              </p>

                I Am Wellbeing is committed to bridging this gap by equipping mental health professionals with the skills, knowledge, and tools to meet this urgent
                need. Our <strong>six-month course on trauma-informed care practices</strong> is designed to build capacity and shift how mental health concerns are understood and managed.
