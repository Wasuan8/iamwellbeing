          “From the very first day I entered this field, the dark realities have
          been unfolding one after another. As a new counsellor at a childcare
          home, standing in front of 55 young girls, each a survivor of sexual
          abuse, violence, and neglect, I realized that none of my degrees had
          prepared me for this. Being a survivor of sexual abuse, I understood
          the deep impact of trauma and the failure of systems meant to protect
          us. It was a moment of reckoning that shifted the course of my life.
          It pushed me to seek deeper training, take intensive supervision, and
          become the kind of therapist I once needed. Working with trauma meant
          unlearning what I knew and building a whole new skill set, one that is
          rooted in presence, compassion, and connection.

              They say it takes a village, but our village was broken. I found
              only a few professionals who truly embodied trauma-informed care.
              But for a country like India, that wasn't enough.
            </p>
            <p className="font-alegreya">
              This sense of scarcity and urgency gave birth to I Am Wellbeing,

              endeavour.
