                With the intention of <strong>building the capacity</strong> of young mental health professionals and students towards trauma-informed practices and holistic healing, I Am Wellbeing conducts various one / two-day trainings facilitated by experts from the field. The rationale behind these trainings stems from the recognition that while academic curricula provide theoretical foundations, a <strong>significant gap often exists between knowledge gained at institutions and the realities of practice.</strong> These trainings are designed to bridge that gap, equipping participants with hands-on skills, reflective practices, and a deeper understanding of trauma-informed care that goes beyond textbook definitions. The trainings are intentionally kept low-cost so that financial constraints do not become a barrier for students or early-career professionals who wish to upskill. In doing so, we intend to open up pathways to high-quality learning that would otherwise remain out of reach.

                The contribution for these trainings is kept between Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 so as to keep them affordable and accessible. All contributions are used for Nairatmya Foundation's work with under-resourced communities. These trainings are open to all students and working professionals in the field of psychology.
